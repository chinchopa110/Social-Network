# My mini Social Network
## I created a simple social network for keeping online diaries. Registered users can interact with each other (likes and comments), and for new users available only view mode.
### In this application I tried to implement some services that were interesting to me. All data is persistently stored in the database(PostgreSQL). I also added a simple front from Bootstrap.
